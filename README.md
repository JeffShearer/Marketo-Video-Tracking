# Video Tracking with Marketo Munchkin
Last Updated 5/21/2015
New enhancements & fixes: 
- Added tracking of player start and end events (Wistia & YouTube)
- Updated token naming conventions
- Fixed an issue with the Wistia tokenized script and player
dimensions.
- Added YouTube player visual enhancements (hid player controls,
disabled suggested videos at video end)

These scripts allow Marketo users to embed Wistia or YouTube-hosted videos onto their landing pages, and intelligently track when the videos are played.
